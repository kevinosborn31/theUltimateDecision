# The Ultimate Decision

My girlfriend can never decide where she wants to go out to eat, so I solved the problem with rails.

Live Website: https://the-ultimate-decision.herokuapp.com/

## Cool features
* Ruby 2.4.1
* Rails website that contains a database of restaurants
* Includes login functionality, and ability to make reviews (Reviews not working on heroku at the moments)
* Admin functionality, admins can edit and delete restaurant entries
* Button that randomly picks a restaurant for you to eat at\
* Need to improve layout and attach reviews to restaurants directly
